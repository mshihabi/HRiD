# HRiD
R function for estimating haplotype richness (HR) from VCF data. Supports bp- or SNP-based windows (incl. consecutive-SNP mode), gap-aware window salvage, optional haploid/hemizygosity handling, and Z-score normalization with HRiD/HRiP p-values. HRiD is approach for positive selection signatures detection; HRiP can indicate balancing selection.
